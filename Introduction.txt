What is Golden Age? =================================================

Golden Age is a mod for Victoria 2 that takes place between the end of the Medieval Age and the beginning of the 7 Years' War (1444-1756). 
The mod is not out yet and is heavily inspired by EU4 for now, something I intend to change.

	| Thanks so much to Idhrendur and Zemurin. Without this program, the work would be much longer or 
	| or it wouldn't even have been created! I used it as a basis for improving the mod and fix a lot of things, 
    | also adapting and creating systems to make a realistic game that matches the period of the game.
