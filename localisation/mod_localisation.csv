The terms said that Henry IV could marry the French king's niece and that, in return, Charles VII would be promised the territory of Maine, in northern France south of Normandy, plus a two-year truce between the kingdoms. However, rulers, including Your Majesty, are refusing to concede Maine to France, because the popular reaction would be bad for the kingdom.
